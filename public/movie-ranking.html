<h1>The top Best Anime According To Oby</h1>
</p>
 <p>
<h2>My top THREE anime Of all Time</h2>
</p> 
 <hr />
<p>I would be honest , the first two were not that hard to decide , but the last one i think would be the hardest one 
for me to decide.</p> 
<h3>Attack On Titan(AOT)</h3>
<p>The graphics, storyline , and the first episode really really , grabbed my attention.And i got to understand that there wasnt any evil person or bad character, each did what they did because they thought it was good.
</p>
<h3>Vinland Saga</h3>
<p>First of, I need to watch this anime again . The character development was flipping insane , the journey or grief , anger and revenge , yoh</p>
<h3>Blue Eyed Samurai</h3>
<p>I know, I know , As how , but hear me out , this anime had everything , love , betrayal , action , i mean the fight scenes , food, friendship, I wont lie , maybe another anime deserves to be there but Im going leave it at this

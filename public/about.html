<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Obiageli Melie. I am a second-year Business Management student at the University of Plymouth, currently undertaking my placement year as a TikTok Assistant Manager at Generation Success.
As an international student from Nigeria, I came to the UK to study Business Management with a strong passion for marketing. 
However, along the way, I fell in love with tech and programming.I'm sure there's a niche that combines both!
</p>

<p>Im a deeply creative person. I love starting from scratch and watching beauty unfold.
Throughout my life, Ive explored music (learning and creating sound), photography, interior design, dancing, content creation, fashion design, and even launched my own retail business.
All of this reflects my love for creating. 
My interest in learning website development comes from this same creative drive.I want to create.</p>

Over the next few weeks, I hope to transform this website from a basic HTML project into something more decorative, functional, and uniquely mine.
I cant wait to see how it grows.</p></h3>
